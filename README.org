* Puppet Profiles
This is a quick refactoring of my =site.pp= and Hiera YAML hierarchy
such that all uses of =create_resources()= are now contained in
profiles. All classes are now included in profiles. All packages and
Ubuntu PPA's are declared in profiles (with the use of
=ensure_packages()= where appropriate).

Included and declared in my [[https://github.com/andschwa/puppet-manifests][puppet-manifests]].
